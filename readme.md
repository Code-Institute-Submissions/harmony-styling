Rational
I wanted to create a website where the user can upload pictures of items of clothing in their wardrobe and then an online sytlist can match the various items into a workable outfit.

The idea is that instead of calling to the customers homeplace this service can be provided online.

The user can log in and subscribe to the service for a fee of 4.99.  The administrator through the /admin page can view the items uploaded and then assign an outfit the the particular user.  There is also a blog site for discussions (comments added via disqus).

This is version 1.0 as it is a proof of concept of uploading items from the user for the admin (online stylist) to put outfits together.  Further enhancements are intended where the outfits are rendered back to the user in a slider format so various matching styles can be mixed and matched.
